The official implementation of KCP: k Closest Points and Maximum Clique Pruning
for Efficient and Effective 3D Laser Scan Matching, accepted for publication in
the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).

KCP is an efficient and effective local point cloud registration approach
targeting for real-world 3D LiDAR scan matching problem. A simple (and naive)
understanding is: <b>I</b>CP iteratively considers the closest point of each
source point, but <b>K</b>CP considers the <b>k</b> closest points of each
source point in the beginning, and outlier correspondences are mainly rejected
by the maximum clique pruning method. KCP is written in <b>C++</b> and we also
support <b>Python</b> binding of KCP (pykcp).
