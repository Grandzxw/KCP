# Examples

We provide two examples (one for C++ and the other for Python 3) These examples
take nuScenes' LiDAR data to perform registration. Please check

- [C++ example with CMake](https://github.com/StephLin/KCP/tree/main/examples/cpp), and
- [Python example](https://github.com/StephLin/KCP/tree/main/examples/python)

for more information.
